## Interaction Flows

### User Request Processing Flow

1. User submits a request to the system
2. Core module receives the request and initializes the execution context
3. Execution module analyzes the request and breaks it down into executable components
4. Knowledge module provides relevant domain knowledge and methodologies
5. Execution module generates an execution plan with compliance checks
6. Core module orchestrates the execution across appropriate modules
7. Results are compiled, validated, and returned to the user

### Continuous Learning Flow

1. System tracks execution performance and outcomes
2. Knowledge module updates its repositories based on new insights
3. Execution module refines its methodologies based on performance metrics
4. Compliance module updates risk assessments and mitigation strategies
5. Core module adjusts configuration parameters for optimized performance
